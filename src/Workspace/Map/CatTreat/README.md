# CatTreat Model Import Instructions

## To import your CatTreat FBX model:

1. **In Roblox Studio:**
   - Go to the `Workspace` → `Map` → `CatTreat` folder
   - Right-click on the `CatTreat` folder
   - Select "Import From File"
   - Choose your `CatTreat.fbx` file

2. **After import:**
   - The model should appear in the `CatTreat` folder
   - Make sure it has a `PrimaryPart` set (right-click the main part → "Set Primary Part")
   - The model should be named "CatTreat"

3. **Verify the model:**
   - It should appear as a Model in the Explorer
   - It should contain the FBX mesh and any textures
   - The PrimaryPart should be positioned correctly

4. **Rojo will automatically sync:**
   - Once imported, Rojo will detect the model
   - The server script will be able to clone and use it
   - You'll see "CatTreat Model cloned successfully!" in the output

## Current Status:
- ✅ Folder structure ready
- ✅ Server script configured to use the model
- ✅ Client script ready to handle Models
- ⏳ Waiting for FBX import

After you import the FBX, the system will automatically use the real model instead of the placeholder Part!
