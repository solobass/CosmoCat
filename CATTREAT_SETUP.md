# CatTreat FBX Asset Setup Guide

## Where to Place Your CatTreat FBX

**Correct Location**: `src/Workspace/Map/CatTreat/CatTreat.rbxm`

## How to Import Your CatTreat FBX

### Option 1: Import via Roblox Studio (Recommended)
1. **Open Roblox Studio** with your CosmoCat project
2. **Import your CatTreat.fbx file**:
   - Go to **File** → **Import**
   - Select your `CatTreat.fbx` file
   - Choose import settings (keep defaults for now)
3. **Place in the correct folder**:
   - In the Explorer, navigate to **Workspace** → **Map**
   - If the **CatTreat** folder doesn't exist, create it
   - Drag your imported CatTreat model into the **CatTreat** folder
   - Rename the model to exactly **"CatTreat"**
4. **Delete the placeholder file**:
   - Remove `src/Workspace/Map/CatTreat/CatTreat.rbxm`
   - Rojo will sync the real model automatically

### Option 2: Direct File Placement
1. **Convert your FBX to RBXM** (Roblox model format)
2. **Place the RBXM file** in `src/Workspace/Map/CatTreat/CatTreat.rbxm`
3. **Rojo will sync** it to Roblox Studio automatically

## Expected Folder Structure
```
src/
└── Workspace/
    └── Map/
        └── CatTreat/
            └── CatTreat.rbxm (or your actual FBX model)
```

## What Happens Next

Once your CatTreat FBX is properly placed:
- ✅ **CollectibleManager** will automatically detect it
- ✅ **Real CatTreat models** will spawn instead of placeholders
- ✅ **Players can collect** the actual CatTreat assets
- ✅ **Points will be awarded** when players touch them

## Testing

After setup:
1. **Run the game** in Roblox Studio
2. **Look for CatTreat objects** floating in space
3. **Move your character** close to them
4. **Verify collection** - they should disappear and give points
5. **Check console** for "Using FBX model for CatTreat" messages

## Troubleshooting

- **Still seeing placeholders?** Check the console for error messages
- **Model not found?** Verify the folder structure and naming
- **Import issues?** Make sure your FBX file is valid and not corrupted
- **Rojo sync problems?** Check that Rojo is connected and syncing

## Next Steps

Once CatTreat is working:
- Add more collectible types (SpaceFish, CosmicMilk, StarTreat)
- Import their FBX models to the same folder structure
- Test the full collection system
- Move on to Phase 3: Player vs Player combat!
